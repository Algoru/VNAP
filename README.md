## what is VNAP?
**VNAP** is a plugin for [Rainbow Servers](http://www.project-rainbow.org/) that uses a MariaDB database in order to register new users and login older users. In that way you can protect your server againts account spoofing.



----
## It's secure?
VNAP applies a MD5 hash into users passwords. It's not the best, but it does the job.

----
## TO-DO

* Add support for more HASH algorithms (like SHA)
* Add other DB support (like MongoDB)

----
## Donations
